                "\n",
                "Many investors want to know how to predict stock prices. If we could predict the price of a share, we could know when the sell and when to buy and make quite a lot of money in the process. For this studio, you work for a small investing firm who wants you to see if you can use linear regression to predict the prices of MasterCard stock based on historical stock price data.\n",

We added a column to the dataframe called `'Converted Date'`. If you look at the output of using `.head()`, you will notice that the converted date is large numbers that don't seem to reflect what we know is a date. We set up this column for you to use your linear regression later because the linear regression model struggles to work with `datetime` values. "
